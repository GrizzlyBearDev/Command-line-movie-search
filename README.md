This is not complete and probably won't work it's been a while since I made it and really don't remember where I stopped.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I made this simple tool so that I could quickly search movies and TV shows from my terminal. It's built using Dart and the OMDb API.

Running the executable will automatically prompt you to type in what you want to want to search and that's all.
